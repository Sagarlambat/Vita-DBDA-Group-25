#Que 1:
#	Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
#	between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
#	The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
#	
#	Hints: 
#
#             Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

#Que2:
#	With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1
#       and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
#	Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#	8
#	Then, the output should be:
#	{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
#	
#	Hints:
#	In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
#	Consider use dict()

#Question3
#	Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
#	Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#	Hello world
#	Practice makes perfect
#	Then, the output should be:
